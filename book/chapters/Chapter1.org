* The First Chapter

is the deepest

Did you know that the Marianas Trench is so deep that you can stack an entire Mt. Everest in it and everything on it would float up to the surface? That would be pretty horrific honestly. Imagine just swimming by minding your own business and a frozen woolly mammoth floats by. If I was a clown fish that is not the way I want to start my week. Mondays? Am i right.
