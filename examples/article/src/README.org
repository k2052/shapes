* Example Article

An example article written in org, with an ever-expanding things; there are code blocks, jsx, and emoji, with more being added as I work on features in my suite of org-mode handling packages and I write things that need new features

#+begin_export jsx
<div id="awesome" className="cat">
#+end_export

** This block is wrapped in an html tag with the id awesome and class cat

Here is a list inside of it;

- Stuff
- More stuff
- cats
- dogs

And here is some js:

#+begin_src js
  const cats = "are awesome";

  const functionOfNothing = () => {
    return "nothing";
  };

  console.log(functionOfNothing()) // -> "nothing"
#+end_src

#+begin_export jsx
</div>
#+end_export

And here is some stuff wrapped in a component called MakePink, which adds some styling that makes things pink:

#+begin_export jsx
<MakePink>
#+end_export

This text is pink! Here is a unicorn :unicorn_face: :wave:

So pink!

#+begin_export jsx
</MakePink>
#+end_export
